# SporkV2
**A Chatbot for VR-Chat powered by a local llm.**

Version two of Spork aims to be a simple and easy to use AI Chatbot for VR-Chat. It uses koboldcpp for the llm-backend and requires it to be set up and ready for api calls.

I have not yet decided on a tts-backend to use for an optimal quality-to-speed ratio.

**Features to add:**
-  open ai tts branch and possibly other branches
-  virtual microphone and speaker for use with a VR-Chat account and client dedicated to the chatbot
